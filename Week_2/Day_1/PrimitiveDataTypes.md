# Primitive Data Types

In JavaScript, all values which are not Objects are collectively known as primitives:

```javascript
undefined;
null;
boolean;
string;
number;
symbol; //(Introduced in ES6 and not something we need to focus on right now)
```

The simplest possible data types ou software can have.

## Objects Are Not Primitives

Arrays and Functions are a sub-category of objects.

Objects have <i>properties</i>, and are used to define more complex dara types (Such as arrays, dates, key-value pairs, and so on).
